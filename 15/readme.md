# JS Capstone: VirBook

## Description:
The app gives a one sentence intro of the story (e.g. pulled from random variations that is stored in your database). One person would start by having say 10 seconds to record something (which transcribes the voice to the text). Then the next person has 10 seconds to ponder and then 10 seconds to speak. They alternate. The app could for example ask how many back and forth you would want and then start this. Record what each person has done and show recordings of the stories others have created through this app. For example, in the beginning when you create a new book, the app could for example say “You’re together eating an ice cream all the sudden,” where it’s the next person’s turn to finish the sentence.
